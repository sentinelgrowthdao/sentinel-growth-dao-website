# RPC Node

The RPC Node, providing Remote Procedure Call and API interfaces is operational. It allows external applications or clients to interact with the Sentinel Blockchain.

RPC nodes typically expose an interface that allows clients to send requests to the node, querying information or requesting certain actions to be performed on the blockchain. This is done through RPC calls, which are remote requests to the node's services.

Sergey, representing Quokka, will be responsible for overseeing its maintenance, ensuring the implementation of essential monitoring measures.
